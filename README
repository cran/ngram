What is this?
====================================================================
This is an R package for constructing n-grams, as well as generating new
text based on the n-gram structure of a given text input.



How do I install it?
====================================================================
To install the package from github, I recommend using Hadley Wickham's
devtools package, which you can get from the CRAN.  After installing that,
you can enter

library(devtools)
install_github(username="wrathematics", repo="ngram")

into an R terminal to install this package.
