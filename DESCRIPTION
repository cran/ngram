Title: Fast n-Gram 'Tokenization'
Version: 3.2.3
Description: An n-gram is a sequence of n "words" taken, in order, from a
    body of text.  This is a collection of utilities for creating,
    displaying, summarizing, and "babbling" n-grams.  The
    'tokenization' and "babbling" are handled by very efficient C
    code, which can even be built as its own standalone library.
    The babbler is a simple Markov chain.  The package also offers
    a vignette with complete example 'workflows' and information about
    the utilities offered in the package.
