\subsection{Installing from Source}

The sourcecode for this package is available (and actively maintained) on 
GitHub.  To install an \R package from source on Windows, you will 
need to first install the 
\href{http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools216.exe}{Rtools} 
package.  To install an \R package from source on a Mac, you will need to install
the latest Xcode, which you can get from the App store.

The easiest way to install \thispackage from GitHub is via the 
\href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html}%
{\pkg{devtools}}
package by Hadley Wickham.  To install \thispackage
using \pkg{devtools}, simply issue the command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=rr]
library(devtools)
install_github("wrathematics/ngram")
\end{lstlisting}
from R. 


\subsection{Installing from CRAN}

The usual
\begin{lstlisting}[language=rr]
install.packages("ngram")
\end{lstlisting}
from an \proglang{R} session should do it.
