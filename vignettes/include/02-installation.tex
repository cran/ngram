\section{Installation}
\label{sec:installation}

In this section, we will describe the various ways that one can install the 
\thispackage package.


\subsection{Installing from Source}

The sourcecode for this package is available (and actively maintained) on 
GitHub.  To install this (or any other) package from source on Windows, you will 
need to first install the 
\href{http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools216.exe}{Rtools} 
package.

The easiest way to install \thispackage from GitHub is via the 
\href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html}%
{\pkg{devtools}}
package by Hadley Wickham.  To install \thispackage
using \pkg{devtools}, simply issue the command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=rr]
library(devtools)
install_github(repo="ngram", username="wrathematics")
\end{lstlisting}
from R.  Alternatively, you could  
\href{https://github.com/wrathematics/ngram/archive/master.zip}%
{download the sourcecode from github}, 
unzip this archive, and issue the command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
R CMD INSTALL ngram-master
\end{lstlisting}
from your shell.


\subsection{Installing from CRAN}

The usual
\begin{lstlisting}[language=rr]
install.packages("ngram")
\end{lstlisting}
from an \proglang{R} session should do it.
